\section{Ticket Generation}
For each HR ticket, we create a fake employee. For all tickets' categories, the employee has some common features: \textit{name}, \textit{first name}, \textit{last name}, \textit{nationality}, \textit{country}, \textit{email}, \textit{company}, \textit{company's email} and \textit{ticket date}.\\
All these information are created exploiting the Python library \textit{Faker}. The nationality and the company's country are selected from the extendible list \{ USA, Germany, Italy, Spain, France \}. All other information are created accordingly to the country picked. So for example if the country of birth of the employee is Italy, then the generated name will be Italian. \\

Then, once the employees are generated, the information specific to the ticket category, created starting from the open datasets as mentioned before, are concatenated to the general information of the employees. \\
For each ticket category there are distinct templates. In each template there is an initial part that contains the general information of the employee, such as name, surname, company\dots, then some prompts correlated to the category of the ticket and then the textual prompt. \\
Here's an example of a template: \\
% TODO: adjust indentation ( maybe see logo page )
%\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{2cm}
From: \$\{email\} \\
To: \$\{company email\} \\
First name: \$\{first name\}\\
Last name: \$\{last name\}\\
Company: \$\{company\}\\
Date: \$\{ticket date\}\\
Ticket category: \$\{category\}\\
Ticket sub-category: \$\{sub category\} \\
Date start absence: \$\{date start absence\} \\
Reason absence: \$\{reason\} \\ 
\\
Dear Sir/Madame, my name is \$\{name\} and I work at \$\{company\}. I am requesting \textless \textit{generate}\textgreater. I hope \textless \textit{generate}\textgreater. \\ \\
%\end{adjustwidth} 
The variables are replaced with the features of the employee, whereas the \textless \textit{generate}\textgreater \space are replaced with text generated by a generative model. The part generated by a pre-trained model are used in a recursive way. This means that the first \textless generate\textgreater \space is replaced with text generated automatically using as prompt everything that precedes it. Then the second \textless generate\textgreater \space will have as prompt the entire ticket, including the text generated previously. The model is forced to generate some text, if no text in an iteration the generation is repeated until the model gives an output not empty.
