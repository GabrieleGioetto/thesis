In order to assess the suitability of the HR ticket dataset for downstream machine learning applications in HR, we exploit the obtained dataset using as labels the categories of the tickets. \\
The goal of testing different downstream machine learning tasks on the dataset is to show that our dataset is sufficiently rich to enable meaningful learning. \\
All the experiments have been carried out using as training data the dataset generated by the model, whereas the test data used was the tickets collected with the survey. \\ 
One of the main motivations to acquire the survey tickets was to have data that had no biases, or at least biases different from ours. Using a portion of the HR tickets dataset as test data would be meaningless, since the model would not necessarily be tested with data that was outside of the one it had been trained with. On the contrary, achieving good results on a portion of the HR ticket dataset would assert the performance of the models used and not the usefulness of the dataset.
